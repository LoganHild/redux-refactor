  ## Installation
  If cloning this repository use the <code>git clone</code> terminal command. Once cloned be sure to use <code>npm i</code> to install the necessary dependencies. After that is completed, enter <code>npm run seed</code> into the terminal to seed the database. After the database is seeded, use <code>npm run develop</code> to run the application in development mode on a local machine.

  ## Usage
  The user may sign up or log in if they have an existing account at the top of the page. Keep in mind that to check out, users will need to have a user account. Browse the products listed and add them to the cart. Once the user has everything they would like to purchase added to their cart, simply click the checkout button and followthe steps listed to make the purchase.
